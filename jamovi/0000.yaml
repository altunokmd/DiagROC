  A module for ROC analysis extended with diagnostic accuracy metrics. This
  module allows users to perform one or more ROC analyses along with diagnostic
  accuracy assessments using the optimal threshold based on Youden's Index. It
  also enables the selection of one or more custom coordinate points for a
  variable, and includes a comprehensive manual calculator. For feature
